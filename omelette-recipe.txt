Heat 1 tbsp of sunflower or vegetable oil in a 20.5cm (8in) nonstick frying pan and add 1 clove crushed garlic, 2 spring onions,
 1 medium tomato and 1/2 medium green chilli, chopped. Cook for 2-3 minutes until soft. Add 1 tsp medium curry powder and 1/2 tsp garam
 masala and fry for a further minute.
Beat 2 eggs together in a small bowl and season. Add the egg mixture to the pan and swirl the pan until the omelette mixture
 is cooked underneath.
Carefully flip the omelette over and cook for 1-2 minutes, until golden. Scatter with 1 tbsp of fresh coriander and serve immediately.
